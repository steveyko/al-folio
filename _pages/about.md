I generally work in the area of systems. My current research interest lies at the
intersection of mobile systems, programming languages, and software engineering.

I received a B.S. degree in [Mathematics](https://math.yonsei.ac.kr/math/index.do) from [Yonsei
University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), an MS in [Computer Science and
Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en) from [Seoul National
University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html), and a PhD in [Computer
Science](https://cs.illinois.edu) from [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). I worked as a postdoc in the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/).

I am currently on leave from the [Department of Computer Science and
Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html) at the [University
at Buffalo, The State University of New York](https://www.buffalo.edu) as an Associate Professor.
